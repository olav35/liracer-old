* liracer
The free and open source code racing game.

** License
The project is licensed under AGPLV3, but I preserve the right to change the license at will. I have no plans of making it proprietary, but I may change the FLOSS license as I see fit.

** Contribute
The easiest way to contribute is to submit a code quote. The quotes are stored in [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer/tree/master/models/quotes][models/quotes/<language>]]. The code quotes need to fullfil the following requirements.
- Use literal tabs(not spaces) for indention.
- Have maximum 79 characters per line.
- Have no trailing newline.
- Be idiomatic and well written.
- Be moderately short.
- Be /interesting/. The code should either display the syntax of a language with a familiar, easily digestible example such as [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer/blob/master/models/quotes/c%2B%2B/fibonacci.cpp][fibonacci.cpp]], [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer/blob/master/models/quotes/c/fizz_buzz.c][fizz_buzz.c]], [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer/blob/master/models/quotes/haskell/hello_world.hs][hello_world.hs]] or    [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer/blob/master/models/quotes/ruby/fibonacci_sequence.rb][fibonacci_sequence.rb]], or be a real-life example.
- Be valid code. The code does not need to be self sufficient, but no syntax errors should be present.
- Be legitimate contributions(not spam garbage).
For a start you can translate an already existing quote to a new language.

** Rewrite
A complete rewrite is in progress at [[https://github.com/olav35/liracer-rewrite]].
